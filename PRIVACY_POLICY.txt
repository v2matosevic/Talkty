1. DATA WE COLLECT
------------------

Talkty is designed with privacy as a core principle. The Software operates
entirely locally on your device and does NOT collect, transmit, or store any
personal data on external servers.

Specifically:

a) Audio Data
   - Audio is captured temporarily in memory during recording
   - Audio is processed locally using the Whisper speech recognition model
   - Audio data is immediately discarded after transcription
   - No audio is ever transmitted over the internet

b) Transcription Data
   - Transcribed text is stored locally on your device
   - You have full control over this data
   - Data is stored in your user profile folder
   - No transcriptions are sent to external servers

c) Application Settings
   - User preferences are stored locally on your device
   - Settings include: selected microphone, model profile, hotkey preferences
   - No settings are synchronized to cloud services


2. DATA PROCESSING
------------------

All data processing occurs exclusively on your local device:

- Speech recognition is performed by Whisper, an AI model running locally
- No internet connection is required for the core functionality
- No data leaves your computer during normal operation


3. DATA STORAGE
---------------

Data is stored locally in the following location:
- Windows: %APPDATA%\Talkty\

You can delete all stored data by removing this folder.


4. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
-----------------------

Talkty does NOT use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.

The Software may check for updates (if this feature is enabled), which requires
an internet connection. No personal data is transmitted during update checks.


5. DATA SHARING
---------------

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your data to third parties.
Since all data remains on your device, there is no data for us to share.


6. DATA SECURITY
----------------

Your data security is ensured by:
- All processing occurring locally on your device
- No network transmission of personal data
- Standard Windows file system security for stored data

We recommend keeping your operating system and security software up to date.
